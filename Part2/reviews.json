            "Very nice improvement over my old 1050ti. Able to run games on high or ultra with no issues. Very quiet and fit my motherboard and case with no issues: I was planning to buy a used gpu but saw this offering from ASUS and thought it was the better way to go. Card is a bit larger than my old 1050ti but it fit into my old computer case and motherboard with no problem at all. Card is very quiet. It also has some cool lighting when its activated. So far, I have seen significant improvement in my game play. I have all games bumped up to high or ultra and it has been running perfectly. Reminder: go into your nvidia control center and bump up the performance to get even more out of the card.Read full review...",
            "Better Than a RX-570: I purchased a gaming PC in mid 2020 and I felt that the RX-570 that was included would play most games including the new Flight Simulator 2020. Not really, so I begin looking for a newer graphics card for the last 5 months or so. The prices started coming down and this really is a good deal for this time in 2021. It works very well in Flight Sim and although I am not the best playing this yet, I do love the graphics, pretty much flawless. I do love the way the card handles just about everything you do with it. And, yes a better price might be had, this was good at the time. Thanks Ebay!!Read full review...",
            "Definitely a good buy!: I honestly have no complaints with this GPU. Prices are extremely high currently and so I was forced to buy a GPU that was part of a lesser generation than I wanted. HOWEVER, all things considered, this GPU runs like a beast with almost no sound. I am very happy that I did decide to buy this GPU instead of waiting for the prices to level out more. I definitely recommend this GPU to someone who is either waiting for prices to drop and need a GPU, or for someone is building a mid-range priced computer. Currently, I am running games at their high-end settings and still reaching 100+ frames which is good enough for me. Again, I definitely recommend this GPU!Read full review...",

            "Amazing!: Got this card as an entry level rtx 2080 and used it as my primary for about 9 months. Everything about my experience with the card has been flawless. The cooling system keeps the card cool under 70 degrees even after 6 hours of game play on ultra graphics. The fans run quiet, even on the most demanding games and the simple rgb colors are perfect for pc enthusiasts who would rather not have their gpu look like a Christmas tree. The only thing I would advise is that you use mai afterburner instead of gigabytes Aorus if you decide to overclock as the application just works better all around. But as for this particular model itself I don't have a single complaint, only praise to Nvidia and gigabyte for the remarkable performance and value this model delivers. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an entry level rtx 2080 as you can find the card used for around 500 and new for under 700.Read full review...",

            "I go for the most stable RTX xx60 series. ALWAYS!: Incredibly quiet, in fact I can't hear it at all and I use an open case configuration. Paired up with an AMD 3900x processor overclocked to 4.2ghz successfully on air, and it runs up to 1440p with no lag or issues at all. I upgraded from a RTX1060 and had to restart my computer 3x until it recognized the new (3060) card which was no problem. I prefer the RTX xx60 series because they seem to be the most reliable and also overclock extremely well and last indefinitely so long as you use stabile numbers. If you choose to go crazy then yes anything will burn up. I also chose to wait until well after COVID as the prices on this model were absolutely ridiculous sometime going up to $900. Glad I waited and this one seems to have been barely used if at all. Out of the shipping box it looked brand new and all the fins were super clean. Worth every penny! Runs very smooth, overclocks radically well. I could have gone with an 8Gb model just as easily and for a tiny bit less money but I use Adobe Lightroom for photography and transferring files in RAW, the extra 4Gb of RAM absolutely make a difference in speed. If your not also doing photography or video work the 8Gb is more than enough for even some of the biggest games. 12Gb for me was pretty much mandatory. Read full review...",

            "Lightly used it seems' runs great: No issues, it actually has less dust than my Rog Strix 1080ti I replaced it with haha.  I'm getting about 30% more FPS on almost MAX settings for most games at 1440p. On my 1080ti I played at Medium/High settings, super optimized and still got less FPS. Good upgradeRead full review...",
            "The Tough GPU: Love these graphics cards! They look great and have a substantial weight to them. I especially like the fan design with the outer ring attaching the fan blades together.

            "Great Gaming card: The 3070 is a great card for the mid-tier gamer.It will play games in 1080p and 4K. 1080p turned up to the max and 4K decently. It beats the previous generation cards and is somewhat futureproof. If you are a top tier gamer who has the best of everything,this is not your card.But if you want decent performance with ray tracing ,this is your card.Read full review...",
            "Great performance , Horrible Pricing: This card is very good and well made with the push pull configuration of the gpu . This in return makes the temps cool . Can run 1440p effortlessly and 4K gaming and medium - high settings depending on the game. My only issue is the price for this GPU \u2026.

It earns our Editors\u2019 Choice award and a perfect 5-star score as the best video-card value of this, or any, year.Read full review...",

So: The 3080 was double boxed with bubble wrap. It looked brand new out of the box. The only indication it used was a little dust on the edge of a fan. So was very well taken care of and worked flawlessly. Overall very happy with this order and would purchase from you again. Thank you!",

            "Very Decent, Older, Entry Level Biginner Class GPU: I specifically wanted this GPU, in order to use a vertically mounted EK \"Special Edition\" water block, in an elite class water cooled video editing, work station custom computer. I'll switch to an Nvidia RTX 4090 FE, if and when EK decides to offer the \"Special Edition\" water block for the 4090. The basic Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is what I would consider a decent, entry level beginner class graphics card. The 12GB version would be preferred. The 3080 cards are outdated, over priced and not a good value today. You're better off going with an RTX 4070 or 70Ti, when they are available, unless you have a special need for the Nvidia RTX 3080 FE Edition, as in my case.",
            "Good card but covered in dust.: The Card has performed well so far. I was quite disappointed when I received the card and it was almost completely caked in dust. There was little attempt to clean it, just wiped off the fans basically. Haven't seen any lack in performance yet but I haven't pushed the card at all.",
            "Best 3080 out there: I already have the Asus Tuf 3080 and both the EVGA FTW3 3080 and 3080ti. I can tell you the Strix 3080 is a cut above these two cards. Great temps. The Strix does draw more power than the Tuf. The Tuf version actually works quite well and has good thermals. The Strix is better but it also clocks higher and consumes 30 to 59 more watts. With the TUF and FTW3, I\u2019ve had problems with paste pump-out. Just the design. Not sure if the Strix has the same problem, but so far the temps are great.",
            "3080: So overall decent.. could definitely tell its been in a mining rig for well over a year. Runs a little hot, not unusable though. Condition wasn't bad either, would almost have looked new with a good cleaning. Overall 4.3/5",
            "Looks good, works gooder: I'm loving my 3080 FE, for the deal I got it at it's incredible compared to my old single fan 1070. A decent bit louder, but not obnoxious, and well worth the performance increase. 6/5 stars as far as I'm concerned. I run just about everything on Ultra/High at 144fps 2560x1440 with it.",
            "Great!: Can be a bit loud when spun up all the way, but I also have an open case so it does nothing to help this.  Works great.  Extremely sturdy, great build quality.  Performs like you'd expect, that is to say, excellently!",
            "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition 10GB GDDR6X Graphics Card: Great card for gaming. The founders edition 3070/3080 are the best card for gpu etherium mining and are never LHR making founders edition cards more valuable. This 3080 shroud is more compact than my 3rd party 3070 so its easier to fit in my case.",
            "3080 oh my: This is one of the best bang for your buck graphics card. It\u2019s perfect for someone who wants something a little higher end for gaming, streaming, and editing. If you\u2019re able to snag one for a price that fits your budget I\u2019d say go for it.",

            "overheats; replace thermals mandatory; good product: Price is cutthroat and Founders Edition has very bad overheating on the V.RAM. That being said, it's exactly what I expected and if the thermal pads are replaced this is a monster of a GPU that is completely unmatched. So I still give 5 star.",
